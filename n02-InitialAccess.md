## Password Spray/Brute-Force

We will use a single password against multiple users that we have enumerated. This is definitely noisy and may lead to detection!

For Azure, password spray attack can be done against different API endpoints like Azure AD Graph, Microsoft Graph, Office 365 Reporting webservice etc.

<br/>

We can use **MSOLSpray** for password spray against the accounts that we discovered.

The tool supports fireprox (https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox) to rotate source IP address on auth request.

```

Invoke-MSOLSpray -UserList C:\AzAD\Tools\validemails.txt -Password SuperVeryEasytoGuessPassword@1234 -Verbose
```
