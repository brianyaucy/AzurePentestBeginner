## Function App - Continuous Deployment

**Functions Apps** (Azure Functions) support continuous deployment. In case continuous deployment is used, a source code update triggers a deployment to Azure.

<br/>

The following source code locations are supported:

- Azure Repos
- GitHub
- BitBucket

**Deployment slots** are supported so that deployments are first done in slots like staging (to avoid deploying directly in the default production slot).

<br/>

## Privilege Escalation

A misconfigured function app that deploys directly in production can be abused.

In this case, **if the source of truth/code location is compromised**, it will be possible to **assume the identity** of the function app.

For example, if GitHub is used as the provider, compromise of a GitHub account that can commit code will lead to compromise of the function app.
